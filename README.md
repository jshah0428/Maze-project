# Maze-project
Maze Project - This project recursively goes through a maze given any random starting and ending point. The example maze is taken from a "maze.txt" file which can be changed by the user.  A starting point is denoted with a '+' and an ending point is denoted with a '-'. Attached is an example of an unsolved vs a solved maze with this code.
